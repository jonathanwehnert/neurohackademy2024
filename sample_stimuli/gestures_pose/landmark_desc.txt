description of landmark creation process for videos in this folder
both mediapipe_estimate_pose_hands Pose and Hand landmarks were created for each frame of each video and saved to 3 separate npy arrays (see below).
additionally they were drawn onto the input videos and saved to this folder for visualization purposes only.
in the visualizations, the finger landmarks were removed from the pose model (as they are included in greater detail in the hand model).
they are nevertheless still included in pose_landmarks.npy


landmark_inputs.csv contains a list (in order) of all videos put into mediapipe_estimate_pose_hands
pose_landmarks.npy, lh_landmarks.npy, rh_landmarks.npy are all organised in the same fashion:
(input_video, landmark, frame, landmark_position)
input_video:     each row of each ndarray corresponds to each row in landmark_inputs.csv
landmark:        each row corresponds to the 33 landmarks (pose) or 21 handmarks for the left (lh_landmarks) & right (rh_landmarks) hands
frame:           progresses through all frames of video one-by-one, with frames exceeding the number of frames in the shortest video removed from all videos
landmark_position: 3-dimensional array. x, y, z coordinates (in that order) of each landmark at each frame
